Tested on Debian Sid, requires:

python-django
python2.7
python-tastypie

My own settings.py which is not shipped in the git repository.

I've tried to include other dependencies, hope I didn't forget anything.


Configure your own settings.py
These variables are needed in it:
REMOTE_API_USERNAME
REMOTE_API_PASSWORD
REMOTE_API_BASE_URL
REMOTE_API_HOSTNAME #Hostname of the remote database
PUBLIC_API_USERNAME #Username to access remotely the REST API
PUBLIC_API_PASSWORD #Password to access remotely the REST API

You will also need to configure haystack (the soruce is included)

Run
./manage.py syncdb

./sync.py #To sync with the remote database.

./manage.py runserver
